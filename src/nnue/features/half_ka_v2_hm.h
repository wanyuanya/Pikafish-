    /* 64 bit encoding related to mid mirror, which is divided into two parts, piece counts and squares except for king
    *
    *  Encoding representations:
    *    Middle king   : | 1 bit | -> Active when king in FILE_E
    *    Piece types   : |advisor|bishop| pawn |knight|cannon| rook |
    *    Piece counts  : | 3 bits|3 bits|4 bits|3 bits|3 bits|3 bits| -> 19 bits
    *    Guarding bit  : | 1 bit | -> Set to one to prevent overflow from piece squares part into piece counts part
    *    Piece squares : | 7 bits|7 bits|8 bits|7 bits|7 bits|7 bits| -> 43 bits
    *
    *  Piece counts for the left flank (i.e. FILE_A to FILE_D) of the board are 1, for the right flank (i.e. FILE_F to
    *  FILE_I) are -1, mirroring that of the left flank but with a negative sign, and for the center is 0.
    *
    *  Piece squares for the left flank of the board are positive, counting from 0 to 39, for the right flank are
    *  negative, counting from -39 to 0, mirroring that of the left flank but with a negative sign, and for the center
    *  is 0. For black pieces, the encoding is vertically flipped.
    *
    *  Encoding for piece at the left flank of the board is positive, for example, encoding for a single piece 'rook'
    *  at square 'A3' (assuming A3 is 33) is:
    *    Middle king   : | 0|
    *    Piece counts  : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 1|
    *    Guarding bits : | 0|
    *    Piece squares : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0|33|
    *
    *  Encoding for piece at the right flank of the board is getting negated, which means a negative sign is added to
    *  the final encoding of that piece, for example, the encoding of the same piece on square 'I3' (assuming I3 is -33)
    *  is:
    *    -(Middle king   : | 0|
    *      Piece counts  : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 1|
    *      Guarding bits : | 0|
    *      Piece squares : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0|33|)
    *
    *  Encoding for piece at FILE_E of the board is all zero, for example, the encoding of some piece on square 'E3'
    *  is:
    *    Middle king   : | 0| (| 1| if the piece is king)
    *    Piece counts  : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 0|
    *    Guarding bits : | 0|
    *    Piece squares : | 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 0|
    *
    *  The overall encoding of a balanced position is (with the concept of complement numbers being used):
    *    Middle king   : | 1|
    *    Piece counts  : | 2| 2| 5| 2| 2| 2|
    *    Guarding bits : | 1|
    *    Piece squares : |39|39|76|39|39|39|
    *  Where 39 can account for subtraction of 0 - 39 for non-pawn pieces and 76 can account for subtraction of two pawns
    *  (0 + 1) - (38 + 39) at most in a balanced position.
    *
    *  Each piece placed will add its encoding to the overall representation, and removing a piece will do a subtraction.
    *
    *  Now we just need to test if the encoding of the board is smaller than balanced position to see if we need mirroring:
    *    If the piece count is imbalanced for both flanks, the result will be fully decided by the first part of the
    *    encoding, regardless of the second part and overflows.
    *    If the piece count is balanced, the first part of the encoding must be the same, and the result will be decided
    *    by the second part, and all overflows of the second part will be automatically resolved at this time.
